            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>
                UQ MARS (Mechatronics and Robotics Society) is a student-driven organization founded as UQ Robotics 
                and rebranded in 2019. Our mission is to inspire and support students in robotics, 
                from academic workshops to competitive challenges and industry connections. 
                We are committed to helping students explore their passion for robotics and technology.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our activities include hands-on technical workshops, networking events, and team-based projects 
                that allow students to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world challenges. 
                Whether you're just starting out or a seasoned enthusiast, UQ MARS is your hub for robotics at UQ.
